Deep-Learning-NER
=================

Implementation of named entitiy recognition using deep neural networks. So far this is just  a mavenisation of the [assignment for this tutorial](http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/NAACL2013/)


Running
=======

run Neural_Network_Driver.java to train the Neural Network

run MEMM_Driver.java to train the Maximum Entropy Markov Model
